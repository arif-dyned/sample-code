# Sample Code Using Go Language
Sample Code is made specially for sample code users who also want to use Go Language as based of the langugae programming. 

## Project Context and features
When it comes to choosing a Go framework, there's a lot of confusion
about what to use. The scene is very fragmented, and detailed
comparisons of different frameworks are still somewhat rare. Meantime,
how to handle dependencies and structure projects are big topics in
the Go community.
